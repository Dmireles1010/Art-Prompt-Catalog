# Community Art Repository

Community Art Repository is a React website that I've developed from scratch. It serves as an archive of artwork from a vibrant art community called "The Golden Gator," where monthly art showcases take place. Each month, community members participate in themed art prompts, creating and submitting their own artwork based on their interpretations of the prompts. The community, which operates as a role play group, actively encourages fans and viewers to contribute their own art.

To facilitate the submission process, artists within the community share their artwork and accompanying descriptions through the community's Discord channel. The website stores these submissions, preserving the description along with the artwork, and provides a direct link to the original submission on Discord. Additionally, the username of the artist who submitted the art is displayed alongside each piece.

While the Community Art Repository no longer receives active updates, you can explore the current and up-to-date artwork from this community by visiting `https://goldengator.booru.org/`. This website I've built now serves as an archive, celebrating the community's rich artistic journey and showcasing a diverse range of artwork inspired by their collective imagination.

Through this repository, we celebrate the creativity and talent within this community, showcasing a diverse range of artwork inspired by their collective imagination.
